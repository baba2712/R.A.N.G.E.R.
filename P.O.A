# **RANGER: Remote Atmospheric Node for Geophysical Environmental Reporting**

## **About the Project**
**RANGER** is a low-cost tethered weather balloon system designed to collect, transmit, and analyze localized atmospheric data. The project combines simple electronics, durable design, and real-world applications in weather monitoring, making it an innovative and resourceful DIY solution.

---

## **Execution Plan**

The project is divided into four main parts for clarity and focus. Each part tackles a specific aspect, from building the electronics to designing the housing and deploying the system.

---

### **Part 1: Electronics Setup**
#### **Goal**
To develop a functional electronic system that can reliably collect weather data and transmit or store it.

#### **Steps**
1. **Component Integration**  
     # Essential Electronics for High-Altitude Balloon

        ## 1. Microcontroller
           - **NodeMCU (ESP8266 or ESP32)**: Controls sensors and communication.
        
        ## 2. Weather Sensors
           - **DHT22 / SHT31**: Temperature & humidity sensor.
           - **BMP280 / BME280**: Pressure & altitude sensor.
           - **NEO-6M GPS**: GPS module for tracking location.
        
        ## 3. Communication
           - **LoRa Module (RFM95 / SX1278)**: For long-range data transmission.
        
        ## 4. Power Supply
           - **LiPo Battery**: Powers the system.

2. **Code Development**  
   - Write the program to:
     1. **Collect data** from sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, and GPS) and format it into a readable message.
     2. **Log data locally** on an SD card or **send it via Wi-Fi** to a cloud server or local server.


3. **Testing and Debugging**  
   - Assemble the electronics on a breadboard.  
   - Test each component individually for accuracy and functionality.

#### **Deliverable**
- A fully functional electronics module ready to be integrated into the payload.

### **Part 2: Capsule Design**
#### **Goal**
To build a lightweight, durable, and weatherproof housing for the electronics and sensors.

#### **Steps**
1. **Material Selection**  
   - Choose lightweight materials like plastic containers, foam boards, or 3D-printed parts.   
   - Ensure the housing is waterproof and shock-resistant.

2. **Design Features**  
   - Include:
     - Compartments for NodeMCU, battery, and other components.
     - Vents for proper airflow to exposed sensors.

3. **Attachment Points**  
   - Add hooks or straps to secure the capsule to the balloon tether.

4. **Weatherproofing**  
   - Seal non-essential openings with silicone or adhesive materials.  
   - Test for durability in wet or windy conditions.

#### **Deliverable**
- A weatherproof capsule ready to house the electronics and be attached to the tethered balloon.

---

### **Part 3: Balloon System**
#### **Goal**
To deploy a helium balloon system capable of lifting the payload and remaining stable in one location.

#### **Steps**
1. **Balloon Selection**  
   - Choose a high-quality weather balloon or similar helium-filled balloon.  
   - Ensure the lift capacity is greater than the payload weight.

2. **Inflation and Tethering**  
   - Safely inflate the balloon using a helium tank.  
   - Use a strong tether (nylon or Kevlar cord) to secure the balloon.

3. **Anchoring System**  
   - Design a secure ground anchor to hold the balloon in place.  
   - Test the system under light wind conditions.

#### **Deliverable**
- A stable tethered balloon system with a secure payload attachment.

---

### **Part 4: Permissions and Project Management**
#### **Goal**
To manage the project effectively, procure resources, and ensure compliance with regulations.

#### **Steps**
1. **Permissions**  
   - Obtain necessary approvals from:
     - Local authorities for operating tethered balloons.
     - Campus administration .

2. **Resource Management**  
   - Prepare a list of required components and members.  
   - have to prep a budget and track expenses.

3. **Timeline and Milestones**  
   - Plan the project in phases:
     - Electronics: Week 1-2  
     - Capsule: Week 2-3  
     - Balloon System: Week 3-4  
     - Deployment: Week 5

4. **Documentation**  
   - Record all designs, test results, and progress.  
   - Create a GitHub repository to share the project.

#### **Deliverable**
- Necessary approvals, a clear budget, and a documented project roadmap.
